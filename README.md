# rpi-dashboard
Web application for monitoring and interacting with a Raspberry Pi based on Express (WIP)

## Installation
_Note: This project depends on nodejs (I've been developing using v10.15.2)_
Clone this repo and execute:
1. `npm install express --save` to install the Express web server
2. `npm install` to install all required modules

Once this completes run the server using `npm start`. It listens on port 3000
